# Bindr
Bindr is the application designed to help the reader and books that will be given away find each other.

# Feature
- Instead of registering the information of the book manually which is the cumbersome task, we introduce an innovative way to registering the book.
- By taking the picture, we extract the text from the book cover picture that the user upload then the application will find the book information automatically.


# Components we use
- Android Studio 3.0
- Google Could Vision API (OCR feature)
- Google Book API
- Minimum level API 24
- Based on Nugat 7.0
